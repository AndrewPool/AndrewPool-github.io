            <p>I liked astronomy(and space stuff) before and now I know a little bit more! Here are some neat things I learned.<p>
            <ul>
               <li>The Milky Way is a Bar/Spiral Galaxy</li>
               <li>Neptune's Moon Triton is retrograde.</li>
               <li>What it means for Mercury to be in retrograde</li>
               <li>How long it takes to count all the squares on a roll of toilet paper is comparable to how large the solar system is.</li>
               <li>The difference between a Neutron Star, and a White Dwarf</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I learned other stuff, but those are the more interesting things, though they're all interesting.</p>

            <h2>"Discussing Realism in 'Terrafroming Mars'"</h2>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraforming_Mars_(board_game)">Terraforming's Wikipedia Page</a>
            <p>In life I habit of playing board games with friends. One of those games is Terraforming Mars, it is a game about settling and transforming mars from a barren red rock to a blue/green planet fit for human life. For this assignment I've recruited two of my gaming buddies, Mark, and Wilson, to play Terraforming Mars while conversing about the “realism” of the different game mechanics. Mark is my friend from grade school who I've been playing games with forever, we have both taken back infinite moves playing chess. Wilson is a mutual friend from Grand Targhee, a company both me and Mark used to work for.</p>
            <p>The game took place on October 13 at an undisclosed location, at noon. 'Mars' has the players take the role of a corporation; Mark was Saturn Systems their advantage was that their economy got better the more Jovian planets are utilized, I was The Republic of Tharsis who specialize in city construction, and Wilson was Thorgate and get a discount on energy production cards. The game consists of playing different cards with different abilities, all the cards are good, the player's goal is to find the best* one. </p>
            <p>During the game you can acquire different resources from mars to continue construction, The “Tree” were the most realistic because when you got enough you were able to build a forest. The “Floaters” were the least realistic because we couldn't figure out what they were supposed to be, other than resources to be spent in the game. Mark's corporation, ThorGate, made it so he was constantly converting his electricity resources into heating for Mars making the warmth the first goal we reached in the game. Long story short, Mark won.</p>
            <p>For the most part, the game's science fiction seems in the mostly hard science zone. Here are some of the more interesting things we discussed about the game's “realism'.</p>
            <h2>Realistic Concepts</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>The Mars surface board maps to real to life</li>
               <li>Can bring different life forms that consume each-other.</li>
               <li>Player options increase/decrease based on how far along the terraforming is.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Unrealistic Concepts</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>Saturn Systems is also Jovian?</li>
               <li>Terraforming probably isn't a thing, unless you count climate change.</li>
               <li>No magnetic field stuff.</li>
               <li>Space ships are seemingly powered by magic.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Good time was had by all, maybe some-other time we'll do another game, see how well it's theme matches it's mechanics.</p>

            <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2019/09/bird-apocalypse-exaggeration-of-the-research.html">Slate Bird Article</a>
            <p>This article is a meta discussion about an article that was recently published in Science. The article in question describes how according to measurements there are something on the order of 3 billion less birds in North America than there was in 1970. That’s a lot of birds. The slate article goes over how the story got published, and also details a parallel social media push on the part of the researchers. The slate article also discusses the sensationalism in headlines describing the research as a “bird apocalypse”. There are some problems with this characterization, first that some of the largest bird population declines are from invasive birds, and also that there isn’t good data for bird populations and we don’t really know what a “natural”  bird population size what might be. I’m not sure what to think as a skeptic, since there is a clearly massive biomass loss over what was the current ‘normal’. This situation could be a sign of doom, if you’re looking for signs of doom, or maybe it’s nothing.<p>

            <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-49855058">BBC Gas Giant Article</a>
            <p>This BBC article is about planetary formation. Apparently, astronomers have found a massive gas giant close to a smallish scale star. This is unexpected given the accretion disc model for how planets form. One explanation is that the planet started farther out and moved closer to the star over time. I think this is a neat article. Sherlocking out how solar systems form is always a good time, the article title is infuriating.</p>

            <p>
               Black Holes are a place where escape velocity is greater than the speed of light, which for some reason has the same speed regardless of frame of reference(idk butchering physics is fun) means that light that goes into never come out, and light that goes near makes some cool glowing parts that are bent/refracted. All in all more complicated than I understand yet super cool to look at. This is nasa’s newest simulation, it has swirling lights that are effected by doppler, and light refracted around the even horizon. Tubular.</p>
