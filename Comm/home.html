  <a href="Comm/Project1.html">My weekend at Bhuddahs</a>
<p>This essay was a great excersice in comparing different world religions to my own. I enjoyed experiencing a new culture and learning about buddhism, I don't get attend religious service often and am obtaining a science degree so this was for sure a novel experience for me.</p>
<p>I in many ways hold similar values to the ones expressed in the service and feel like values of patience and being willing to take the good with the bad will help in my work doing programming.</p>
