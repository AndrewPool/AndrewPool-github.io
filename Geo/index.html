           <p>Did you know that the famed nuclear power plant Chernobyl is in Ukraine. The plant was built when Ukraine was apart of the USSR. This National Geographic piece details the meltdown, evacuation and containment of the plant in 1986. Recently before the war the area was visited by tourists. But it isn’t safe for prolonged human exposure, also watch out for the wolves.

           <p>Institute for the Study of War (ISW) is a think tank. An American think tank. An American think tank formed to help better fight Iraqi insurgents during the US invasion of Iraq. But at any rate they’ve been putting out daily campaign assessments showing where the belligerents forces are. The commentary is insightful, even if all the predictions don’t pan out. You can forgive ISW’s existence it’s hard to find better coverage. </p>

           </p>
           <p>Is the site of the journalist website Oryx. Oryx is Turkish in nationality, but the website is translated into many different languages. This is an article that lists all the documented instances of a Russian military hardware being made casualty. Visual confirmation is the best way to determine losses on the battlefield, at least in relation to the two sides. Oryx also keeps track of Ukrainian losses. So far Russia has taken over 3 times the vehicle losses. </p>

           </p>
           <p>Kyiv Independent is an English language newspaper based in Kyiv Ukraine. The newspaper keeps a newsfeed for the war. Some/Most of the sources are in Ukrainian, so you kinda just have to take their word for it when they quote someone. The highlighted article is an informative piece about a battle that is anticipated to take place. Russia is trying to fully annex the provinces that Putin has taken a nibble out of. This follows a failure initial phase where Ukraine successfully defended the capital from a blitzkrieg. Great article and newspaper.</p>

Accessed 2 May 2022.
</p>
           <p>Remember the radioactive disaster zone at the Chernobyl power plant? 1500 Russian invaders dug into the area and held it for the Russian army. The soil was contaminated with radioactive dust but the soldiers dug trenches and other fortifications anyways. It is not known if the soldiers knew of the risk they took being near to Chernobyl. The looting of radioactive material and equipment at the laboratory monitoring the plant suggests that they didn’t. At any rate the army left behind mines after they retreated this will pose a challenge to remove in the hellscape. </p>
